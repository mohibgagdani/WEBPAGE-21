        <b>Diamond,</b> a mineral composed of pure carbon. It is the hardest naturally occurring substance known; it
        is also the most
        popular gemstone. Because of their extreme hardness, diamonds have a number of important industrial
        applications.


        An uncut diamond in rock
        Diamonds are found in various types of rock deposits and must be mined and cut to produce the brilliant
        gemstone used in
        jewelry.
        The hardness, brilliance, and sparkle of diamonds make them unsurpassed as gems. In the symbolism of
        gemstones, the
        diamond represents steadfast love and is the birthstone for April. Diamond stones are weighed in carats (1
        carat = 200
        milligrams) and in points (1 point = 0.01 carat). In addition to gem-quality stones, several varieties of
        industrial
        diamonds occur, and synthetic diamonds have been produced on a commercial scale since 1960. (See also
        industrial
        diamond;Diamonds are found in three types of deposits: alluvial gravels, glacial tills, and kimberlite pipes.
        The kimberlite
        pipes (such as those at Kimberley, South Africa) form from intrusions of magma into the Earth’s crust and
        deliver
        diamonds and other rocks and minerals from the mantle. The pipes themselves are often less than 100 million
        years old.
        However, the diamonds they carry were formed 1 to 3.3 billion years ago at depths of more than about 75 miles
        (120 km).
        Diamonds found in alluvial and glacial gravels must have been released by fluvial or glacial erosion of the
        kimberlite
        matrix and then redeposited in rivers or in glacial till.Diamonds vary from colorless to black, and they may be
        transparent, translucent, or opaque. Most diamonds used as gems
        are transparent and colorless or nearly so. Colorless or pale blue stones are most valued, but these are rare;
        most gem
        diamonds are tinged with yellow. A “fancy” diamond has a distinct body color; red, blue, and green are rarest,
        and
        orange, violet, yellow, and yellowish green more common. Most industrial diamonds are gray or brown and are
        translucent
        or opaque, but better-quality industrial stones grade imperceptibly into poor quality gems. The color of
        diamonds may be
        changed by exposure to intense radiation (as released in a nuclear reactor or by a particle accelerator) or by
        heat
        treatment.
