        Gold is one of the densest of all metals. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity. It is also soft
        and
        the most
        malleable and ductile of the elements; an ounce (31.1 grams; gold is weighed in troy ounces) can be beaten
        out
        to 187
        square feet (about 17 square metres) in extremely thin sheets called gold leaf.Because gold is visually
        pleasing
        and workable and does not tarnish or corrode, it was one of the first metals to
        attract human attention. Examples of elaborate gold workmanship, many in nearly perfect condition, survive
        from
        ancient
        Egyptian, Minoan, Assyrian, and Etruscan artisans, and gold continues to be a highly favoured material out
        of
        which to
        craft jewelry and other decorative objects. (see metalwork; goldwork.)craft jewelry and other decorative
        objects. (see metalwork; goldwork.)Gold is one of the noblest—that is, least chemically reactive—of the
        transition elements. It is not attacked by oxygen
        or sulfur, although it will react readily with halogens or with solutions containing or generating chlorine,
        such as
        aqua regia. It also will dissolve in cyanide solutions in the presence of air or hydrogen peroxide.
        Dissolution
        in
        cyanide solutions is attributable to the formation of the very stable dicyanoaurate ion, [Au(CN)2]−.

        Like copper, gold has a single s electron outside a completed d shell, but, in spite of the similarity in
        electronic
        structures and ionization energies, there are few close resemblances between gold on the one hand and copper
        on
        the
        other.

    <font size="5">
        The characteristic oxidation states of gold are +1 (aurous compounds) and +3 (auric compounds). The state +1
        is
        generally quite unstable, and most of the chemistry of gold involves the state +3. Gold is more easily
        displaced from
        solution by reduction than any other metal. Even platinum will reduce Au3+ ions to metallic gold.

        Among the relatively few gold compounds of practical importance are gold(I) chloride, AuCl; gold(III)
        chloride, AuCl3;
        and chlorauric acid, HAuCl4. In the first compound, gold is in the +1 oxidation state, and in the latter
        two, the +3
        state. All three compounds are involved in the electrolytic refining of gold. Potassium cyanoaurate,
        K[Au(CN)2], is the
        basis for most gold-plating baths (the solution employed when gold is plated). Several organic compounds of
        gold have
        industrial applications. For example, gold mercaptides, which are obtained from sulfurized terpenes, are
        dissolved in
        certain organic solutions and used for decorating china and glass articles.
