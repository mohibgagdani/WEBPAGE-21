            Initial Foray :
        </b>
        The journey of Tanishq started with the launch of 18k gold watches studded with precious stones in 1994. But, it
        soon
        grew into a 22K jeweller who presented a stunning range of gold and diamond jewellery. The term Tanishq was
        coined by
        Mr. Xerxes Desai by marrying the words ‘Tan’ meaning body and ‘Nishk’ meaning a gold ornament and Tanishq’s very
        first
        state-of-art jewellery factory with a proper karigaar park was set up in Hosur in Tamil N.
